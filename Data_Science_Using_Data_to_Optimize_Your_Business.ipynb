    "In this exercise, we’ll be seeing a real-world example of how a company can use data to optimize the business decisions they make. Studies show that data-driven organizations not only make better strategic decisions, but also enjoy high operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and robust profit and revenue levels.\n",

    "It is also important to note that it is not enough simply to have data, but derive meaningful insights from that data—and convert knowledge into action. Moreover, companies must not only focus on existing data, but the creation of new and useful data. Data creation and capture are moving data science beyond analysis and into the realm of managing when and how data is collected, annotated, and organized. For example, A/B tests on your business’s website are a simple way to create new data that measures how your website performs, how customers interact with it, and how you can improve those interactions."
